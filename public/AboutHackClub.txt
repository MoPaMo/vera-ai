Wikipedia: Hack Club is a global nonprofit network of high school computer hackers, makers and coders founded in 2014 by Zach Latta. It now includes more than 500 high school clubs and 31,000 students. It has been featured on the TODAY Show, and profiled in the Wall Street Journal and many other publications.
Hack Club's primary focus is its clubs program, in which it supports high school coding clubs through learning resources and mentorship.
Hack Club is funded by grants from philanthropic organizations and donations from individual supporters. In 2019, GitHub Education provided cash grants of up to $500 to every Hack Club "hackathon" event. In May 2020, GitHub committed to a $50K hardware fund, globally alongside Arduino and Adafruit, to deliver hardware tools directly to studentsâ€™ homes with a program named Hack Club Summer of Making. In 2020, Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation donated $500,000 to help expand Hack Club, and donated another $1,000,000 in 2021. In 2022, Tom and Theresa Preston-Werner donated $500,000 to Hack Club.
